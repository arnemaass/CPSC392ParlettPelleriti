# Introduction

Description of the data (e.g. What variables do you have? Where is this data from? How much data do you have? Anything notable about the data). 


# Question 1: Why is the sky Blue?

Here is my very detailed discussion of the answer to this question, as well as how I found the answer (e.g. describing the models, presenting the graphs, discussing the implication).

If you want a table you can make one with [this website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and paste the markdown table here. For example:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |

    "Homework 4 is a group assignment, you may work in groups of up to 3. Please tell Dr. Parlett who is in your group, so she can add you in Canvas. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. A [README.md](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/Admin/READMEexample.md) with all the relevant information\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "We're going to build a Neural Network to predict which number a picture is of. The possible digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9. Each image contains only one digit, and has 784 pixels (it's a 28x28 grayscale image). We're going to treat each pixel as a feature. So think of it like having 784 columns. Each column tells you the color value of that pixel in the image. \n",

    "## Modelling\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Using sklearn `Pipelines`, build a logistic regression model to predict digit (similarly to how we built a Decision Tree in class).\n",
    "- Print out the accuracy (`accuracy_score`) for both the train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Neural Network\n",
    "- Take the Neural Network we built together in class and make it DEEP. Add *at least* 5 **more** `Dense` layers to your model. Remember, we typically go from more units to less units.\n",
    "- Train the model for at least 100 Epochs (this may take a while)\n",
    "- Print out the accuracy score (`model.evaluate()`) for both the train and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've built your models, answer these questions to help your group learn more about Neural Networks. Some of these questions may require you to do some outside research with your group, others might require information from the lecture, and others are about the models you built. Put the answer to these questions in your **Results** section in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do your models perform (discuss accuracy, overfitting for both train/test)? Is one model better than the other? Are you surprised by which one did better?\n",
    "2. What happens to the loss and accuracy of your train/test set as you go through all 100 epochs (include a plot of the loss over time for both train and set set, and a plot of the accuracy over time for both train and set set)?\n",
    "3. ðŸ’» What is the job of a loss function in general? What specific **loss function** does your model use? Why is this loss function appropriate for predicting digits (0-9)\n",
    "4. ðŸ’» What is an activation function? What activation function did we use in your Neural Network? Why is this activation function appropriate for predicting digits (0-9)\n",
    "5. The first argument in any `Dense()` layer is the number of nodes in that layer. How many nodes does your last Neural Network layer have? Why did we choose that number?\n",
    "6. If you had more complicated images, like images of pets which you're classifying as \"Corgi\" or \"Not Corgi\", do you think a logistic regression would do well? Why or Why not.\n",
    "7. What's the benefit of using Deep Neural Networks compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees...etc?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction**: description of the problem (e.g. what are you predicting? How might this model be useful if you are successful). You should end with a sentence or two about what the impact of these models could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods**: describe your models in detail (as if explaining them to someone who's not a data scientist, like a CEO), as well as any pre-processing you had to do to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results**: Describe the performance of your models, and answer the questions listed in the cell above.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Discussion/Reflection**: A few sentences about what you learned from performing these analyses, and at least one suggestion for what you'd add or do differently if you were to perform this analysis again in the future."

# **Introduction**
description of the problem (e.g. what are you predicting? what variables do you have available? How might this model be useful if you are successful). You should end with a sentence or two about what the impact of these models could be.

# **Methods**

Describe your models in detail (as if explaining them to the CEO of the streaming service), as well as any pre-processing you had to do to the data.

# **Results**

How well did your models perform according to the various metrics, were the models overfit (how can you tell)? What do those performance metrics (Acc, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC, Calibration...) tell you about the model? How much do you trust the results of your models? **Which one model would you choose to put "in production"? What are the pros and cons of each model (think about model performance, time/space complexity, interpretability...etc)**. Is the model well calibrated? Does that matter? How would you suggest the CEO use the classification model you chose? How would you suggest the CEO strategically use the movie suggestions you generated? 

# **Discussion/Reflection**

A few sentences about what you learned from performing these analyses, and at least one suggestion for what you'd add or do differently if you were to perform this analysis again in the future.


If you want a table you can make one with [this website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and paste the markdown table here. For example:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |

(Note that the `width=300` argument controls how wide your image will be.)

Add an image from your local computer (note: this is a filepath on *my* computer, you'd need to change it to a filepath on *your* computer.)

# Introduction

Description of the problem (e.g. what are you predicting? what variables do you have available?). You should end with a sentence or two about what the impact of these models could be.

# Methods

Describe your models in detail, as well as any pre-processing you had to do to the data (e.g. missing value handling, z-scoring, feature engineering...etc). For example: Did you predict `salary` or `salary_in_usd`? Explain the reasoning for your decision.

# Results

How did your model perform? What doe those performance metrics mean in context? Did your model perform better/worse in difference circumstances? was one model better than the other? Did you need `PolynomialFeatures()` (which includes both polynomial features and interactions)? How well did your model perform according to the various metrics, was the model overfit (how can you tell)? How much do you trust the results of your model (in other words, would you be confident about using it in the real world to predict salaries? Why or why not?)

If you want a table you can make one with [this website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and paste the markdown table here. For example:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |
| a | b | c | d | e |

**Also** answer the two questions you chose from part 2 above. Include the image, a caption as well as your written answer.

## *Question 1*: Why is the sky blue?

# Discussion/Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned from performing these analyses, and at least one suggestion for what you'd add or do differently if you were to perform this analysis again in the future.

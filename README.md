## Resources
* [Lecture Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmxpwhh4FDm5zuA_63jV6iiz5wrg76UHV)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): a shareable online jupyter notebook. Like google docs for code (but instead of being able to see changes live, you can only see other people's changes when you save and re-open notebook). Great for collabing with other people, or for storing your code online.
* [OBS Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/): Great for recording your presentation.
* [Slack](https://slack.com/): A place to ask me questions, meet with other students, share fun data sets...etc.
* HP Smart [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-easy-scan/id967004861?mt=12) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.printercontrol&hl=en_US): An app that will let you "scan" things to PDF using the camera on your phone/tablet. Great for sending me signed documents, or other important files.

    "## Alt-Texts\n",
    "Alt-texts are text descriptions of an image that are read aloud to users using screen-readers. While anyone can benefit from alt-texts, it's especially important for people with visual impairments. In the lecture we talked about ways to make our visualizations more accessible (high contrast, large, clear font, contrasting colors...), but alt-texts take it one step further. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an alt-text is to convey the relevant information in plot to a user. Things like color/texture are not super relevant to users who cannot see, but you still want to communicate the information that color/texture is emphasizing, like the differences between groups. Let's create an alt-text together:\n",

    "### Activity\n",
    "Your group was assigned a simple ggplot, write a good alt-text for it. Remember, the reader won't know things about ggplot, so instead of saying \"There's a geom_line()\" you can describe the line e.g. \"This is a solid line that shows the average rating over the years 2008-2021\". Once you're done, share your alt-text with the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once everyone is done, you will take another group's alt-text and try your best to re-create the plot. The better your alt-text, the easier it will be! \n",

    "\n",
    "You can add alt-texts on most common websites. On Twitter, you can click the ALT button to add a description, on LinkedIn, when uploading an image you can click the Alt. text tab and add an alt-text. On Slack, once you upload an image, you can click the `...` menu on the image and select 'Edit File Details' and add a Description. "

## Formatting 

# Header 1
Using a single # gives you a really large header!

## Header 2
Using two # gives you a slightly smaller header!

### Header 3
...and on

#### Header 4
...and on

##### Header 5
...and on

You may also want to use a bulleted list!

- just
- like
- this
- one

Or maybe an ordered list!

1. like
2. this
3. one

To emphasize your point you might want to use *italics* or **bold**. 

To have something appear as code (using a monospace font), surround everything that is code with ticks \`like this\`, so that it shows up `like this`.

If you're the math-y type, you will be happy to know that you can write LaTeX in .qmd files as well! For a full line formula, use two \$\$ dollar signs at the begining and end of your LaTeX:

```
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 2y
$$
```

will appear as 
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 2y
$$

For in-line LaTeX just use one \$ in your text. For example, $x + \beta$

You may also want to put a [link](https://www.google.com) to a website for reference. Or, insert an image!

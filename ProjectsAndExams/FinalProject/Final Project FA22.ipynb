    "(**10 points**; Due Friday April 29th at 11:59pm; PDF) Pretend you're a company who is interested in the dataset you chose. Come up with at **least 7 questions** that you want to answer based on the variables (at the top of this document, **provide a short description of each of the variables in the model**). Use [THIS FORMAT](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/ProjectsAndExams/FinalProject/Example%20of%20Questions%20Format.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions can be about the relationships between variables, or how well one thing can predict another, clustering...etc, but note that in your final project you must use at least **1 supervised learning model** (includes both regression and classification models), **1 clustering model, and 1 instance of dimensionality reduction** (PCA or LASSO), so keep that in mind when creating questions. You can use more than one of these for a single question (e.g. using PCA and then doing linear regression on the components).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on the quality of the questions. Questions should be interesting and complex (e.g. questions like \"is this model more than 90% accurate?\" should be expanded to something like \"is this model accurate as measured by accuracy, examination of patterns in the confusion matrix and/or consistent accuracy across gender/race/income/education groups?\"). Questions related to the same model/analysis should be included as 1 question (for example, if you build a model predicting cat weight from cat height, cat age, and cat diet, the question should be somthing like \"which variables have the strongest impact on cat weight?\" instead of having three separate questions \"what is the impact of cat height on cat weight?\", \"what is the impact of cat age on cat weight?\", and \"\"what is the impact of cat diet on cat weight?\")\n",

    "(**27 points**; Due Friday May 6th 11:59pm; PDF) Now put on your data scientist hat. Write an **ORGANIZED analysis plan** to answer **3** of the questions you came up with. Think about which of the questions need a predictive model, which need a clustering model, which need dimensionality reduction, and which maybe need just visualizations/summaries.

    "- For Part II, #5 You should work on it together. Again, you need to answer 2 questions **per member** (so a group of 2 would need to answer 4 questions, a group of 3 would need to answer 6). You must ALSO submit a joined statement (as a PDF) describing what each member did. Each of you should submit a copy of this.\n",
    "- For Part II, #6 You each need to make your OWN video presenting on 2 of the questions each, however you can collaborate on the presentation materials (the slides..etc). Each of you should submit a separate video.\n",

    "5. A **PDF** of your python notebook. Please get rid of extra analyses/code that you did not end up using. You must clearly indicate where each question is being answered using Titles in Markdown. Also include a **README**, and **joint statement of who did what** (EACH group member must submit a copy of the SAME documents).\n",
    "6. A **link** to a short video presentation (do not send the video directly). Each group member does their own video.\n",
    "7. A **Feedback Form** given to you by Dr. Parlett. Each group member will review separate students/groups.\n",

    "## Independent Project Option\n",
    "If you want to use your project to use data to affect the *real world* you can propose a different final project, however it *must* have a real world component and include *proof* of real world application (e.g. you can use data to write a report on climate change to send your local representative or congress person, you can use data to change the types of sales you have in your Etsy Shop, you can create/source/scrape and analyze a new data set and publish it on GitHub (especially if it's a data set that helps fight bias, e.g. get more BIPOC faces for face recognition), or contribute meaningfully to an open source data project). You'll need to meet with me during class, office hours, or via Slack to agree upon the structure of your project. The project must use SOME skills from this course."

1. Understand computational issues related to data mining on the large scale.
2. Enumerate standard algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning
3. Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization
4. Formulate techniques for outlier detection and data cleaning for domain-specific data sets
5. Carry out statistical analysis of data
8. Analyze data for patterns
9. Build statistical models of large data sets

## Program Learning Outcomes
The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Education Learning Outcomes
Students create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc., as appropriate).

## Overview
This course provides a survey of algorithms, tools, and techniques for computing with Big Data.  Students will be exposed to fundamental concepts in data mining, machine learning, and information retrieval systems, with special emphasis on techniques for data visualization and analysis.  Recent advances in high performance computing, such as map-reduce, will be presented in the context of Big Data.  Students will apply data mining algorithms to data sets from biology, chemistry, social media, and industry using several popular machine learning packages.


## Prerequisites:
CPSC 230, and MATH 203 OR MGSC 209.

## Units:
CPSC 392 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:
NONE. Optional Reading is linked on the Front Page of the Course GitHub.

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Canvas and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):
Homework will consist of assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at 11:59pm (unless otherwise specified). Homework and Project must be turned in with a README file as either a .txt or a .md file (see Admin Folder on GitHub for a template).

### Late Days
Stuff happens. So, you have 3 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). If an assignment was due Monday at 11:59pm and you use 1 late day, the assignment would then be due Tuesday at 11:59pm.

To qualify for an extra day, you must fill out the **Late Days Google Form**  linked on Canvas under the Syllabus Tab *BEFORE the assignment is due*. Fill the form out **ONCE per late day used** (e.g. if using two late days, fill out the form twice). Because of these "extra days", late work will automatically be penalized a 0.15% per hour (or part of an hour) late. You must ALSO put a comment on the assignment (in CANVAS) indicating how many late days you used (e.g. "I used 2 late days") *Because of grading deadlines, extra days CANNOT be used during finals week and may not prevent peer feedback during the final project.*

Again, to use a Late Day:

1. Fill out the Google Form
2. Leave a Comment on your Canvas Submission

### Assignments
All programs must be written in **Python** unless otherwise specified, and should use the packages taught in this course. Grading will be based on correctness, clarity, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.)

### Assessment Structure
There will be weekly quizzes on the lecture material and classwork, which will count toward the Quizzes grade. Missed quizzes can not be made up. However, I will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores at the end of the semester, so use these 2 dropped quizzes to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be two in-class exams. In-class exams must be taken on the dates specified, however *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

Finally there will NOT be a final exam, rather there will be a final project and presentation.

## Course Communication
Information for the course will mainly be disseminated through our Course Slack. YOU MUST join the course slack channel and check for updates. Email through Canvas may also be used. Materials will also be available through the course GitHub (https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti).

## Collaboration Policy:
You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, Large Language Models (or other AI), other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

## Chapman University’s Academic Integrity Policy
